  <h3></h3>
The cell wall is what it is called, the "wall" of the cell. 
Cell walls are foud in all cells except  animal cells. 
In plants the cell wall is made of cellulose. 
In fungi, it is made of chitin, and in bacteria cells, it is made of peptidoglycan. 
The cell wall provides extra support and protection for cells. 
As a result, the cells are a lot less fluid. 
Also, the cell wall helps prevent water loss, and it keeps the cell stable under turgor pressure.

Fun Fact:

Cell walls made of cellulose are very difficult to digest, meaning only animals with strong digestive systems like cows can digest
and gain energy from them.
