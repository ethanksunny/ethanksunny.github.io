<h3>
The Golgi Apparatus is the "protein warehouse" of the cell.<br>It is the center for packaging and shipping proteins.<br>Proteins form the ER come to the Golgi apparatus to be modified, packaged ito a vesicle, and then shipped to its destination.<br> Without the Golgi apparatus, cells would not be able to deliver proteins to their desired location.
