The cytoplasm is the fluid found in cells.<br>All othe organelles are found floating in the cytoplasm.<br>The cytoplasm of the cell cointains enzymes which help break down waste.<br>The cytoplasm keeps all organelles in place, ut the cytoplasm itself is shaped by the cytoskeleton.The cytoplasm also cointains cell nutrients.<br>Without the cytoplasm, the cell would be deflated, and all the organelles would not be able to keep their position.
