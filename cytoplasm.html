<h3>
The cytoplasm is the fluid found in cells.<br>All othe organelles are found floating in the cytoplasm.<br>The cytoplasm of the cell contains enzymes which help break down waste.<br>The cytoplasm keeps all organelles in place, but the cytoplasm itself is shaped by the cytoskeleton.The cytoplasm also cointains cell nutrients.<br>Without the cytoplasm, the cell would be deflated, and all the organelles would not be able to keep their position.<br>Fun Fact:<br>Ribosomes that make enzymes (Digestive Proteins) float in the cytoplasm, unlike ribosomes that produce proteins to leave the cell,
which are found in the Rough ER.
