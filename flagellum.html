The main function of Flagella and Cillia is to move cells.
Flagella is like a long tail on a cell, it pushes the cell like a motor.
Cillia are shorter more hair like apendages that function as "oars" to push the cell through the water.
These organelles are common in prokaryotes, protists, and some animal cells.
The flagella and cilia of ekaryotic cells are said to have a 9+2 pattern, 
meaning they have 2 microtubules in their center, and 9  doublet microtubules between their "skin" and their centermost microtubules.

Fun Fact:

There are many cillia on cells in your respitory track, which keep debris from falling into your lung by moving them away.
