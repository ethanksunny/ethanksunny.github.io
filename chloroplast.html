<pre>
The Chloroplast synthesizes(makes)carbohydrates for the cell through photosynthesys.
Water + Solar Energy + Carbon Dioxide = Carbohydrate + Oxygen.
Choloroplasts are PLASTIDS, organelles bound in double membrane with internal membranes and/or vesicles.
Disk like membranes called THYLAKOIDS are stacked in formations called GRANA.
Space inside thylakoids contains pigments like clorophyll that "catch" solar energy.
Space outside of thylakoids contains enzymes, these synthesize carbohydrates.

Fun Facts:

Cells with choroplasts, like algae and plant cells also have mitochondria which take the carbohydrates choroplasts make 
and convert them to energy.
