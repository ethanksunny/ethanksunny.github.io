Lysosomes have a simular shape to vesicles.
Lysosomes are the "recyclers" of the cell. Lysosomes break down worn out cells, remove waste, and engulf viruses.
Lysosomes contain digestive enzymes to do this. Lysosomes are also slightly acidic.
In plant cells, vacuoles filled with digestive enzymes function as vacuoles.

Fun Fact:

Lysosomes are involved in a procces called Programed Cell Death or "Cell Suicide".
