  <h3></h3>
The cytoskeleton is best compared to the bones and muscles in the human body.
It is made of various proteins.
It supports and shapes the cell, as well as helping with motion.
Much of the cytoskeleton is like a "highway" for vesicles and other intracellular materials to travell on.
The cytoskeleton is not fixed, in fact, it can be assembled and dissasembled.
Most of the cytoskeleton orginization occurs in the centrosomes.
The three main components of the cytoskeleton are actin filaments(micro filaments), intermidiate filaments, and microtubules.
ACTIN FILAMENTS
Actin filaments are incredibly thin and flexible.
They often form directly below the cell membrane.
In plant cells, actin filaments form a "road" for chloroplasts to move.
Avcin filaments are highly involved in cell motion.
They also pinch of the cell during animal cell division.
INTERMIDIATE FILAMENTS
As evidenced by name, intermidiate filaments are between microtubules and actin filaments in size.
Intermidiate filaments help create junctions between cells. intermidiate made out of kerating reinforce skin.
Even though they are strong, they are highly dynamic.
MICROTUBULES
As long as functioning for structural purposes like other filaments, it also creates a spindle to moove and distribute
chromosomes during cell division.

Fun Fact:

A plant poison called colchine stops assembly of microtubules.
