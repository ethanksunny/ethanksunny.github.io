<h2>
The mitochondrion is the "powerhouse" of the cell.<br>It is made up of a double membrane, folds called cristae, and a inner matix with DNA and ribosomes.<br>The mitochodrion is responsible for cellular respiration, which produces of ATP.<br>Carbohydrate + Oxygen = Energy (ATP) + Water + Carbon Dioxide.<br>Different cells have different amounts of mitochondria.<br>For example, blood cells have very few mitochondria,but muscle cells have hundreds of mitochondria.<br>Muscle cells need mitochondria to produce lots of ATP for movement.<br>If it were not for the mitochondria, the cell would not be able to use energy.<br>

Fun Fact:

Mitochondria's inner DNA suggests that it originates from a bacteria living inside a larger eukaryotic cell. 
This is called the endosymbyotic hypothesis, and it also applies to chloroplasts.
