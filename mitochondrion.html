<h2>
The mitochondrion is the "poweerhouse" of the cell.<br> The mitochodrion is responsible for cellular respiration, and it is responsible for the production of ATP.<br>Different cells have different amounts of mitochondria.<br>For example, blood cells have very few mitochondria,but muscle cells have hundreds of mitochondria.<br>Muscle cells need mitochondria to produce lots of ATP for movement.<br>If it were not for the mitochondria, the cell would not be able to use energy.<br>
