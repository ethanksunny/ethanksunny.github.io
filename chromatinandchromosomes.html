Chromatin is a combination of DNA and proteins that is tightly packaged into chromosomes. The chromosomes have all of a cells genetic infromation.
In cell reproduction, chromosomes are copied to pass on genes. Without chromosomes, there would be no genetic infromation for a cell, and thus the cell
would pretty much die and be able to pass its genes through generations.
