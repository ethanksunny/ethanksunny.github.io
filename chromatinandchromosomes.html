Chromatin is a combination of DNA and proteins that is tightly packaged into chromosomes. 
The chromosomes have all of a cells genetic information.
In cell reproduction, chromosomes are copied to pass on genes. 
Without chromosomes, there would be no genetic infromation for a cell, 
and thus the cellwould most likely die and fail in passing its genes to the next generation off offsprings.

Fun Fact:

Chromatin is inside the nuclear envelope, surrounding the nucleolus.
