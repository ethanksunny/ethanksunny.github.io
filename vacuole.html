The vacuole is a vesicle like sack in cells that stores necesar materials.
There are many small vesicles in an animal cell, and one large one in a plant cell that can take up to 90% of the cell.
They store water, waste, and certain ions.
In plant cell vesicles, the large shape helps support individual cells and mantain pressure.
A vacuole is like backup for a cell, containing spare materials that may be neccesary in the future.

Fun Fact:

Some protists and algae in freshwater habitats have CONTRACTILE VACUOLES, which pump out excess water that comes into the cell. 
if these were to stop functioning, the cell could swell and eventualy burst in a procces called lysis.
