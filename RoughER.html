The rough ER is responsible for synthesizing proteins.<br>The rough ER is embedded with ribosomes which create proteins.<br>The ER recieves mRNA with the code for the sequence of amino acids to make proteins.<br>Then, the ribosomes create the proteins.<br>Then the proteins go to the Golgi apparatus to be shipped throughout the cell.<br> Withouth the Rough ER, the cell would not be able to make any proteins.

Fun Fact:

Because the Rough Er is part of the endomembrane system, the system that deal with proteins, it is made up of the same material as vesicles.
